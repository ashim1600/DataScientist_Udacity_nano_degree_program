 ## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
 Beyond the Python Anaconda distribution, no additional libraries should be required to execute the code in this section. Python versions 3.* should work without a hitch with this code.
 The IPL dataset must be downloaded from Kaggle. The data is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nowke9/ipldata) for download. </br>
 The dataset has 2 files: </br>
    1. allmatches.csv having every match detail from 2008 to 2019 and </br>
    2. delivery.csv having ball by ball detail for every match.
 ## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>   
 This is a Nanodegree assignment from Udacity. IPL data from 2008 to 2019 was of interest to me for this project because it would help me better comprehend team statistics, venue statistics, and winning statistics:   
Question1. Venue-Wise - What decision does teams generally take after winning the toss
Question 2Matches hosted in each city
Question3 Most Dismissals by a WicketKeeper
Question4 How many times each teams have won the toss ?
Question5 Decision upon winning the toss by teams.
Question6 % of matches won batting first/fielding first
## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
Data analysis and modeling are contained in the notebook **IPL Predictive Analytics.ipynb**. </br>
allMatches.csv contains information on each game from 2008 to 2019. </br>
Delivery.csv contains ball-by-ball information for each game from 2008 to 2019.
## Results<a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available https://medium.com/@ashimshrm/study-of-indian-premier-league-data-f68b04d5563c in this blog.
## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
